Fantasy Wikipedia Apps

Working on a proper rails app, but for now you can pull scores using the file wikip.rb.  The method get_updated_projections will pull data from stats.grok.se and print in a hash format, which can replace the data saved in VALUES.  The method display_team_scores shows standings and team breakdowns.
